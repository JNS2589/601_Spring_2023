We don’t need those in our data, since we can use R functions to total employees by state. It also looks as if CANADA is listed as a state. Assuming we are only interested in the US, let’s remove that as well.\nWe can use the filter() and grepl() function to remove both the total rows and Canada from this dataset.\n\n\nCode\nRailroadEmployment <- RailroadEmployment %>% \n  filter(!grepl(\"Total\", STATE))\n\nRailroadEmployment <- RailroadEmployment %>% \n  filter(!grepl(\"CANADA\", STATE))\n\n\nFinally, we noticed we had some NAs in both the STATE and the TOTAL columns. We can use the na.omit() function to remove these from the dataset.\n\n\nCode\nRailroadEmployment <- print(na.omit(RailroadEmployment))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2,930 × 3\n   STATE COUNTY               TOTAL\n   <chr> <chr>                <dbl>\n 1 AE    APO                      2\n 2 AK    ANCHORAGE                7\n 3 AK    FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR     2\n 4 AK    JUNEAU                   3\n 5 AK    MATANUSKA-SUSITNA        2\n 6 AK    SITKA                    1\n 7 AK    SKAGWAY MUNICIPALITY    88\n 8 AL    AUTAUGA                102\n 9 AL    BALDWIN                143\n10 AL    BARBOUR                  1\n# … with 2,920 more rows\n\n\nLet’s run the same code chunk from earlier to check that our edits have been made and the data is clean.\n\n\nCode\nRailroadEmployment %>% \n  group_by(STATE) %>% \n  summarize(mean(TOTAL)) %>% \n  print(n=111)\n\n\n# A tibble: 53 × 2\n   STATE `mean(TOTAL)`\n   <chr>         <dbl>\n 1 AE             2   \n 2 AK            17.2 \n 3 AL            63.5 \n 4 AP             1   \n 5 AR            53.8 \n 6 AZ           210.  \n 7 CA           239.  \n 8 CO            64.0 \n 9 CT           324   \n10 DC           279   \n11 DE           498.  \n12 FL           111.  \n13 GA            56.6 \n14 HI             1.33\n15 IA            40.6 \n16 ID            43.4 \n17 IL           186.  \n18 IN            92.8 \n19 KS            64.1 \n20 KY            40.4 \n21 LA            62.1 \n22 MA           282.  \n23 MD           196.  \n24 ME            40.9 \n25 MI            50.4 \n26 MN            63.6 \n27 MO            73.2 \n28 MS            27.1 \n29 MT            62.8 \n30 NC            33.4 \n31 ND            45.0 \n32 NE           148.  \n33 NH            39.3 \n34 NJ           397.  \n35 NM            67.5 \n36 NV            62.2 \n37 NY           280.  \n38 OH           103.  \n39 OK            31.8 \n40 OR            70.4 \n41 PA           196.  \n42 RI            97.4 \n43 SC            49.9 \n44 SD            18.2 \n45 TN            54.4 \n46 TX            89.8 \n47 UT            76.7 \n48 VA            82.1 \n49 VT            18.5 \n50 WA           134.  \n51 WI            54.7 \n52 WV            60.6 \n53 WY           131.  \n\n\nThis is more like it!

The first two columns, STATE and COUNTY, are character variables, while the last column, TOTAL, is a double variable, which means it contains numeric data.\n\n\nCode\nhead(RailroadEmployment)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  STATE COUNTY               TOTAL\n  <chr> <chr>                <dbl>\n1 AE    APO                      2\n2 AK    ANCHORAGE                7\n3 AK    FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR     2\n4 AK    JUNEAU                   3\n5 AK    MATANUSKA-SUSITNA        2\n6 AK    SITKA                    1\n\n\nUsing the summary() function we can see that the minimum number of employees in county is 1, the maximum is 8207, the median is 21 employees, and the mean is a little over 87 employees.\n\n\nCode\nsummary(RailroadEmployment)\n\n\n    STATE              COUNTY              TOTAL        \n Length:2930        Length:2930        Min.   :   1.00  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:   7.00  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :  21.00  \n                                       Mean   :  87.18  \n                                       3rd Qu.:  65.00  \n                                       Max.   :8207.00  \n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at this dataset to get a sense of which county and which state each have the most railraod employees. We can use piping and the arrange() function in R to see which counties have the most railroad employees:\n\n\nCode\nRailroadEmployment %>% \n  arrange(desc(TOTAL))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2,930 × 3\n   STATE COUNTY           TOTAL\n   <chr> <chr>            <dbl>\n 1 IL    COOK              8207\n 2 TX    TARRANT           4235\n 3 NE    DOUGLAS           3797\n 4 NY    SUFFOLK           3685\n 5 VA    INDEPENDENT CITY  3249\n 6 FL    DUVAL             3073\n 7 CA    SAN BERNARDINO    2888\n 8 CA    LOS ANGELES       2545\n 9 TX    HARRIS            2535\n10 NE    LINCOLN           2289\n# … with 2,920 more rows\n\n\nThis shows that Cook County in Illinois has the most railroad employees. Given that the major city, Chicago is located in Cook County, this is not surprising. It is interesting that Cook county has almost twice as many railroad employees as the next county on the list, Tarrant county in Texas.\nThis data can also shed light on which states have the most railroad employees. We can use piping and the group_by(), summarize(), sum() and arrange() functions to show the states with the most railroad employees:\n\n\nCode\nemployees_by_state <- RailroadEmployment %>% \n  group_by(STATE) %>% \n  summarize(total_state_employees=sum(TOTAL))\n\nemployees_by_state %>% \n  arrange(desc(total_state_employees))\n\n\n# A tibble: 53 × 2\n   STATE total_state_employees\n   <chr>                 <dbl>\n 1 TX                    19839\n 2 IL                    19131\n 3 NY                    17050\n 4 NE                    13176\n 5 CA                    13137\n 6 PA                    12769\n 7 OH                     9056\n 8 GA                     8605\n 9 IN                     8537\n10 MO                     8419\n# … with 43 more rows\n\n\nThis shows that Texas is the state with the most railroad employees."
